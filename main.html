	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
	<p>
		Time complexity is a way to measure how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. 
		An algorithm with lower time complexity is generally more efficient and can handle larger inputs in less time.
	</p>
    
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to execute, relative to its input size. 
		For example, an algorithm with a space requirement of O(n) uses memory proportional to the size of the input.
